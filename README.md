## 🚀 Projects

### Hello World - Interactive Face Drawing
**Location**: `/hello_world/`

A JavaScript project demonstrating canvas-based graphics using Konva.js. Features multiple face drawing variations with different geometric styles and interactive elements.

**Key Features**:
- Three distinct face drawing algorithms
- Geometric and organic shape combinations
- Interactive canvas rendering
- Live development server setup

**Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, Konva.js

### Color Projects
**Location**: `/color/`

Experiments with color theory, manipulation, and visual effects.

### Layout Projects  
**Location**: `/layout/`

Explorations in visual composition, grid systems, and responsive design patterns.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Modern web browser
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CSVAD25
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific project**:
   ```bash
   cd hello_world  # or color, layout
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if the project has a package.json):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
