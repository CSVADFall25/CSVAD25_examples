# Motion

This folder contains interactive p5.js sketches and examples related to motion, animation, and vector mathematics.

##Examples

- **basic_vectors_ease/**: Demonstrates vector-based motion and easing functions for smooth animation.
- **basic_vectors_ease_position/**: Shows how easing can be applied as a function of position.
- **frame_animation/**: Example of frame-by-frame animation using PNG sequences.
- **motion_path/**: Animates an object along a custom path using interpolation.
- **oriented_motion_path/**: Animates an object along a path, rotating it to match the direction of motion.
 - **forces_animation/**: Single-butterfly forces example using PNG frame animation.
 - **butterfly_particles/**: A particle system of multiple ButterflyMover objects (includes `index.html`).

## How to Run

1. Open any subfolder and launch the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Each sketch uses p5.js and may include additional assets (images, sounds) in an `assets/` folder.
3. Some sketches support keyboard controls for changing animation parameters or toggling features. See on-screen instructions or comments in the code.

## Requirements

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library (included in each sketch's `libraries/` folder)
- Modern web browser

## Credits

- Some examples inspired by "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman
- Developed for CSVAD25 course
